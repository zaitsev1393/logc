# logc
Minimalistic to be package for colorful console logs.

- Wrapper for console.log to colorize console outputs
- Uses js proxies to catch colors and put it in the background
- Example
-- logc.red("Pen") - printing out "Apple" on the red background
-- logc.indigo("Pineapple") - guess what happens
-- logc["#424269"]("Apple") - ugly but still works
-- logc.info("Info") - one of the predefined core colors
-- logc.lol("Lol") - just prints out "lol" in a normal way

To be continued.
